ANNEXURE C: PRICING AND PAYMENT TERMS

1. Pricing

Payment = Solar Tariff X Energy Output

Where:

Payment = | Monthly payment due to System Owner for Energy Output, which shall be
calculated into its EGP value on a monthly basis at the Agreed Exchange Rate as
of the date Energy Output for the relevant month is invoiced.

Solar Tariff = | 0.0603 USD per kilowatt-hour for the first fifteen (15) Operating Years of the
Agreement; and

pay to the System Owner interest at the Secured Overnight Finance rate + 2% percentage points per annum
(the “Default Rate”) on a pro-rata basis from the due date until the date the Payment is actually received by the
System Owner and shall also indemnify the System Owner for any FX Loss/Gain the System Owner may incur
due to the Agreed Exchange Rate on the date payment is actually received being less favourable to the System
Owner than the Agreed Exchange Rate on the Overdue Date of such payment. Should the FX Loss/Gain be a
negative amount because the Agreed Exchange Rate has become more favourable, then System Owner shall
credit the relevant amount to Customer against the amount due on the invoice following receipt of the overdue
amount.

Ifa bona fide dispute arises with respect to any invoice, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts and shall,
prior to the due date under the relevant invoice, provide a reasonably detailed explanation of its objections to

hereunder, including payment of undisputed amounts owed hereunder. Any query concerning a disputed sum
that remains unresolved by the Parties for 30 days shall be resolved per the terms set forth in Clause 26. Ifan
amount disputed by Customer is subsequently deemed to have been due pursuant to the applicable invoice,
interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on such amount from the due date under such invoice until the date
payment is actually received by the System Owner, and the Customer shall in addition, pay the System Owner
the corresponding FX Loss/Gain, if any. If an amount disputed by Customer is subsequently deemed to entitle
the Customer to a refund of amounts actually paid, interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on such amount
from the date of the overpayment under such invoice until the date paid, and the System Owner shall pay the
Customer the FX Loss/Gain, if any.

3. Payment Security & Parent Company Guarantee

As a condition for System Owner's obligations under the Agreement, Customer shall provide and maintain in
full force and effect a parent company guarantee in the form agreed separately by the Parties. Where the
Customer fails to make payment of any amount hereunder within 30 days after the due date, the System Owner
shall be entitled to draw on the Customer payment security, following which Customer shall, within 5 business
days after any such draw, procure that such payment security be replenished so it again covers the full required
amount.
