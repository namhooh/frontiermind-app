## 3. Clause-by-Clause Variation Analysis

### 3.1 Term & Duration

| | ERG Molo | IVL Dhunseri | Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Initial Term** | 20 years from COD | **25 years** from COD | 20 years from COD | **12 years** from Transfer Date |
| **Renewal** | Not specified | 1 x 5 years | **2 x 5 years** | Extension to 13th year if energy threshold not met |
| **Maximum Duration** | 20 years | 30 years | 30 years | ~13 years |

Garden City is the shortest. IVL has the longest initial term (25 years) matching its location in Egypt (high irradiance, longer payback). ERG Molo's 20-year term reflects the combined-facility investment scale.

### 3.2 Tariff & Payment

| | ERG Molo | IVL Dhunseri | Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Base Tariff** | USD 0.0837/kWh | USD 0.0603/kWh (Yrs 1-15), USD 0.0570/kWh (Yrs 16-25) | USD 0.0654/kWh | **USD 0.26/kWh** |
| **Escalation** | 2.5% per annum | **None** (step-down only) | 1% per annum | US CPI |
| **Currency** | USD | USD converted to EGP at Agreed Exchange Rate | USD | USD |
| **Payment Period** | 30 days from invoice | 30 calendar days from invoice | 30 days from invoice | 30 calendar days from Statement |
| **Late Payment Rate** | SOFR + 3% | SOFR + 2% | SOFR + 3% | **1-year LIBOR + 2%** |
| **FX Protection** | N/A | FX Loss/Gain indemnity (EGP/USD) | N/A | N/A |
| **Payment Security** | Performance Bond (bank guarantee) | Parent Company Guarantee | Not specified | Security Interest (debenture) |

Garden City's tariff (USD 0.26/kWh) is roughly **4x higher** than the others, reflecting its 2014 vintage when solar costs were far higher. IVL's two-tier declining tariff with no escalation is unique. The FX protection mechanism in IVL (Agreed Exchange Rate via Central Bank of Egypt + 1%) addresses Egypt's currency volatility.

### 3.3 Performance Guarantees

| | ERG Molo | IVL Dhunseri | Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Solar PR Guarantee** | Monthly PR values (76%-81%), 0.5%/yr degradation | Monthly PR values (72%-81%) | Implicit via Required Energy Output | **78%** overall PR |
| **Required Energy Output** | N/A (uses PR + availability) | **90%** of Expected Energy Output | **80%** of Expected Energy Output | Energy Threshold (minimum aggregate) |
| **Availability Guarantee** | 98% (solar), 98% (thermal) | N/A (bundled into REO) | N/A (bundled into REO) | **95%** (separate from energy output) |
| **Shortfall Mechanism** | Liquidated damages ($/yr per 1% deviation) | Shortfall Payment formula | Shortfall Payment formula | Deemed delivery at Energy Potential for Client Risk |
| **LD Cap** | USD 200,000/yr combined | Capped per Operating Year | Capped per Operating Year | N/A |
| **Heat Rate Guarantee** | 8,800 kJ/kWh, <1%/yr degradation | N/A | N/A | N/A |

ERG Molo is the only agreement with thermal performance guarantees (heat rate). The 90% vs 80% Required Energy Output threshold between IVL and Maisha is significant — IVL holds the System Owner to a higher standard, likely reflecting the larger system size and higher irradiance in Egypt.

### 3.4 Force Majeure

| | ERG Molo | IVL Dhunseri | Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Notice Period** | 7 days | 7 days | 7 days | **15 days** |
| **Extended FM Trigger** | **365 days** continuous | **365 days** continuous | **365 days** continuous | **180 days** continuous |
| **Outcome after Extended FM** | Negotiate; Customer purchases at ETC or SO terminates | Negotiate; Customer purchases at ETC or SO terminates | Same as IVL | **Any party may terminate** |
| **Term Extension for FM** | Not explicit | Yes (term extended to recover lost output) | Yes | No |
| **Exclusions** | Standard | Standard + "reduced demand" excluded | Standard | Standard + explicitly excludes late delivery, contractor delay, wear & tear |

Garden City's 180-day threshold (vs 365 days elsewhere) allows faster exit from prolonged force majeure. Garden City also uniquely allows **any party** to terminate after extended FM (not just the customer/buyer).

### 3.5 Events of Default & Remedies

#### System Owner / Seller Default

| | ERG Molo | IVL / Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Insolvency** | Yes | Yes | Yes (60-day stay) |
| **Failure to operate** | 90 days + 90-day cure | 90 days + 90-day cure | 30 days no Energy Output (Technical Fault/SFA Risk) |
| **Material breach cure** | 30 days + 90-day extension | 30 days + 90-day extension | 30 days + 90-day extension |
| **False representation** | Not explicit | Not explicit | Yes (explicit) |
| **Failure to achieve Transfer/COD** | Not explicit | Not explicit | Yes (180 days past Opening Date) |

#### Customer / Buyer / Client Default

| | ERG Molo | IVL / Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Payment failure cure** | **15 Business Days** | **15 Business Days** | **45 days** from invoice |
| **Insolvency** | Yes | Yes | Yes (60-day stay) |
| **Site access denial** | Not explicit | Not explicit | 10 days |
| **Failure to commence operations** | Not explicit | Not explicit | 186 days post-COD |
| **Change in Ownership non-compliance** | Not explicit | Not explicit | Yes |

Garden City has notably **longer payment cure periods** (45 days vs 15 Business Days) but adds unique default triggers like failure to commence business operations and change-in-ownership non-compliance.

### 3.6 Termination Payments

| | ERG Molo | IVL Dhunseri | Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | **4 tiers** (A=Buyer EOD, B=Seller EOD, C=FM, D=Pre-COD Seller EOD) | Single schedule (USD/Wp declining annually) | Single schedule (similar to IVL) | Single declining balance (straight-line monthly) |
| **Calculation Method** | Project Debt + Equity IRR model (lower of actual or 10%) + Contractor Costs | Fixed USD/Wp per Operating Year | Fixed amount per Operating Year | **Straight-line amortization** of Transferred Liability |
| **Year 1 Value** | USD 7,563K (Buyer EOD) / USD 4,911K (Seller EOD) | USD 0.74/Wp (approx. USD 2,398K) | Similar structure | USD 2,387K |
| **Final Year Value** | USD 391K (Buyer EOD) / USD 64K (Seller EOD) | USD 0.02/Wp (approx. USD 65K) | Similar structure | USD 17K |

ERG Molo's termination payment structure is far more sophisticated, distinguishing who defaults and using an equity-IRR-based model tied to a financial close model. The SSA template uses a simpler per-Wp declining schedule. Garden City uses the simplest approach: straight-line monthly amortization of the total contract price (USD 2,402,324).

### 3.7 Dispute Resolution

| | ERG Molo | IVL / Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Step 1** | — | CEO/Designated Representative negotiation (20 Business Days) | Mutual discussions (30 days) |
| **Step 2 (Technical)** | Expert Determination | Expert Determination (financial disputes) | — |
| **Step 3** | **ICC Arbitration** | **LCIA Arbitration** | **LCIA Arbitration** |
| **Arbitrators** | **3** | 1 | 1 |
| **Seat** | London | London | London |
| **Language** | English | English | English |

ERG Molo uses ICC with 3 arbitrators (reflecting higher-value disputes for a combined-facility project), while all others use LCIA with a single arbitrator.

### 3.8 Insurance

| | ERG Molo | IVL / Maisha | Garden City |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Construction Phase** | Seller: Construction All Risks (full replacement value) | System Owner | SFA / Approved Contractor |
| **Operating Phase** | Seller: Operating All Risks (full replacement value) | Shared (SO for property, Customer for site) | **Client** (full replacement cost from Transfer Date) |
| **Public Liability** | USD 10,000,000 per occurrence | Not specified | SFA: up to $1,000,000 per event |
| **Subrogation Waivers** | Not specified | Not specified | Yes (in favor of Funding Party) |
| **Cancellation Notice** | Not specified | 30 days | **60 days** |

Garden City shifts **operating-phase insurance responsibility to the Client** (buyer), which is unusual. In the SSA template and ESA, the seller/system owner carries the primary insurance burden.

---

## 5. Summary of Key Differentiators

1. **ERG Molo stands apart** as a project-finance-grade ESA for a multi-technology facility. Its complexity (14 schedules, equity-IRR-based termination model, performance bond, fuel specifications, forecasting regime) reflects the ~$7.5M+ investment in a remote mining operation. It is the only agreement with thermal and BESS components.

2. **IVL Dhunseri and Maisha share the same template** (standard CBE SSA) with identical clause numbering. Differences are purely commercial: IVL has a longer term (25 vs 20 years), higher REO threshold (90% vs 80%), a unique two-tier tariff with no escalation, and Egypt-specific FX protection mechanisms.

3. **Garden City is the oldest and most structurally different**. Its three-party model separating EPC/O&M (SFA) from financial counterparty (Funding Party) was the early Solar4Africa model, later simplified into the two-party SSA template. It lacks several modern clauses (Change in Law, Environmental Benefits) and uses distinct terminology throughout (Transfer Date, Interconnection Point, Client Works, Termination Amount).

4. **Tariff evolution is striking**: from USD 0.26/kWh in 2014 (Garden City) to USD 0.06-0.08/kWh in 2021-2023 (others), reflecting the dramatic decline in solar PV costs over the decade.

5. **All four agreements converge on**: English governing law, London-seated arbitration, USD-denominated tariffs, seller/system-owner-retained environmental attributes (where addressed), and similar force majeure frameworks, indicating a consistent CBE legal philosophy despite evolving templates.
